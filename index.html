    <div class="date"><span class="bold">Effective Date:</span>&nbsp;02/19/2025</div>
    <div>Thank you for choosing to use our application ("App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our App to create and manage to-do lists.</div>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <div>Our App is designed to function solely on your device. We do not collect, store, or send any personal or task-related data to any third party or server. All information, including your task lists, is stored locally on your device using the @react-native-async-storage/async-storage library.</div> 
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <div>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>We only use your data to provide the core functionality of the App.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Your information remains on your device and is not transmitted or shared with anyone.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Local Storage:</span> All your data is saved directly on your device. We do not have access to, nor do we manage, the data stored on your device.</li>
      <br>
      <li><span class="bold">Security:</span> While we strive to use best practices in securing your data locally, the security of your data ultimately depends on the security measures you maintain on your device (e.g., device passcodes, software updates).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <div>Our App does not integrate with or use any third-party services to collect or process your data. All features of the App operate entirely on your device.</div>
    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <div>Our App is not directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us immediately.</div>
    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <div>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Post the updated Privacy Policy on this page.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Update the Effective Date at the top of the policy.</li>
      <br>
      We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.
    </ul>
